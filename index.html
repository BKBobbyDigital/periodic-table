	<h3>1 Hydrogen</h3>
	<p>The lightest and most abundant chemical element, constituting roughly 75 % of the Universe's chemical elemental mass.

	<p>It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert monatomic gas that heads the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions. Next to hydrogen, it is the second most abundant element in the universe, and accounts for 24% of the elemental mass of our galaxy.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<h3>3 Lithium</h3>
	<p>Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black, tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs free in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, usually ionic ones.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5730 years.[9] Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.[10][11] The name "carbon" comes from Latin language carbo, coal.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<p>Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78.08% by volume of Earth's atmosphere. The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in breaking the bond to convert the N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas. Nitrogen occurs in all living organisms, and the nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from air into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<h3>8 Oxygen</h3>
	<p>Oxygen is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table, and is a highly reactive nonmetallic period 2 element that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with almost all other elements. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless, odorless, tasteless diatomic gas with the formula O2. By mass, oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium and the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the volume of air.</p>
<p>All major classes of structural molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that comprise animal shells, teeth, and bone. Oxygen in the form of O2 is produced from water by cyanobacteria, algae and plants during photosynthesis and is used in cellular respiration for all complex life. Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms. </p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<h3>9 Flourine</h3>
	<p>Fluorine forms a single bond with itself in elemental form, resulting in the diatomic F2 molecule. F2 (fluorine) is a supremely reactive, poisonous, pale, yellowish brown gas. Elemental fluorine is the most chemically reactive and electronegative of all the elements. For example, it will readily "burn" hydrocarbons at room temperature, in contrast to the combustion of hydrocarbons by oxygen, which requires an input of energy with a spark. Therefore, molecular fluorine is highly dangerous, more so than other halogens such as the poisonous chlorine gas.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<p> It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal and is a member of the alkali metals within "group 1". It has only one stable isotope, 23Na. Sodium is an essential element for all animal life (including human) and for some plant species. In animals, sodium ions are used in opposition to potassium ions, to allow the organism to build up an electrostatic charge on cell membranes, and thus allow transmission of nerve impulses when the charge is allowed to dissipate by a moving wave of voltage change.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<h3>12 Magnesium</h3>
	<p>It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, where it constitutes about 2% by mass, and ninth in the known Universe as a whole. This preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Magnesium ion's high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<p> A multivalent nonmetal of the nitrogen group, phosphorus is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms – white phosphorus and red phosphorus. Although the term "phosphorescence", meaning glow after illumination, derives from phosphorus, the glow of phosphorus originates from oxidation of the white (but not red) phosphorus and should be called chemiluminescence. Due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element in nature on Earth. Phosphorus is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and also the phospholipids that form all cell membranes. It is, thus, an essential element for all living cells. The most important commercial use of phosphorus-based chemicals is the production of fertilizers.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

It is an essential element for life and is found in two amino acids: cysteine and methionine. Its commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers, but it is also widely used in black gunpowder, matches, insecticides and fungicides. Elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by mineral collectors for their brightly colored polyhedron shapes.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite. In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%), uranium-235 (0.7204%), and a very small amount of uranium-234 (0.0054%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating the age of the Earth. Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

	<p>It is an actinide metal of silvery-white appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, forming a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen and silicon. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that can spontaneously ignite. It is also a radioactive poison that accumulates in bone marrow. These and other properties make the handling of plutonium dangerous. The most important isotope of plutonium is plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,100 years. Plutonium-239 is the isotope most useful for nuclear weapons.</p>	<ul class="links"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium">Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

Several unusual applications, such as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.
